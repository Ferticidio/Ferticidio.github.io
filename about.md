I like using markdown to write and takes notes. I think is the easiest way to get some kind of formatting without interrupt the writing flow.

I tried a lot of tools. Nowadays the main one is [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), but I wanted some other useful to share links. I didn't want to use [my personal blog](http://ferticidio.com/), there I write in spanish and another kind of content.

Github feels very natural for software developers (Like me) and I wanted to try [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)... And here we are.
